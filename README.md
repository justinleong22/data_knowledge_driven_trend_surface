## Data-knowledge-driven trend surface analysis

### What is this repository for?
This repo is for a data-knowledge-driven trend surface analysis, where the trend surface analysis is a common task in geostatistics and geological interface modeling. Data-knowledge-driven means that we combine many different data sources including borehole data and geophysical surveys and also geological knowledge such as the delineation from geologists. 

This repo has the trend surface analysis both on the explicit modeling and implicit level-sets modeling. We present three different test cases: 

1. Modeling a Greenland subglacial topography, with ice-penetrating radar measurement, using explicit modeling. 
2. Modeling a magmatic intrusion, with discrete borehole measurements, using implicit modeling. 
3. Modeling palaeovalley structures in Australia, with Airborne Electromagnetic survey using implicit modeling.
